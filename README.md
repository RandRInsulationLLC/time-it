# time-it
Pull the pcm, put a distributor on it, turbo charger the manifold, reinvent the timing method with outerspace shit.
The vehicle chassis and body cowl is a 1998-9 Dodge Durango 4x4.  Calibration, VIN, PCM is 5.9l stock motor. The motor is stamped Chrysler do I'm guessing it is actually a 5.7 lb or a 318.  The transmission is near I can tell a 1977 Torque? Having the modulating Valve and governing valves sensors electric rather than hydraulic.  The air manifold is from a mid eighties model New Yorker? Having a turbo charger with the air injection completely removed and converted to a fuel injection/plug arrangement. Cam sensor, one crank sensor in the bell housing, with cylinder heads from God knows what. That is only the beginning
Frankenstein has returned to my garage.  My initial experience with auto mechanic knowledge is the round thing turns the vehicle and the things on the floor have the opposite effect of one another.  I walked away from college just short of a degree in quantum feild theory.  I bit off more than I can chew.  Damn the torpedos full speed ahead.
